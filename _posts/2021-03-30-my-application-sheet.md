title:  "My Application Sheet"
layout: post
---

March 29th, 2021. I just wanted to let it registered somewhere the day I really started applying to jobs. Done. Somewhere down the road, I think it will be nice to look back and find this blog post.

Besides this memento, which probably is not interesting to you, there's something else that I want to share. Since I'll probably be doing hundreds of applications, I figured that one way to keep track of them was creating a google sheet, like so:

![application-sheet](/assets/images/application-sheet.png){:class="img-responsive"}

This figure is still cropped, there are two more columns: `response date` and `OBS`. Here's the [document link] if you want to take a better look. Feel free to make a copy of it.

The idea here is to have all relevant information about your applications in one place. With this data maybe you can learn what version of your CV is more effective, what roles better match your profile (based on responses to each role), response time, and so on.

Note that the columns are a work in progress. I just started it, so I'll be adding, removing, and editing them along the way.

Hope this is useful for us.
