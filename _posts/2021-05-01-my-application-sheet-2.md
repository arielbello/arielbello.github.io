title:  "My Application Sheet II"
layout: post
---

May 1st, 2021. I really wanted to write earlier, it has been a month since the last post. But full-time candidate life is very hectic if you fully commit to it (spend around 8h every day between reading job posts, applying, interviewing, doing code challenges, skills assessments, and whatever a company may ask you to do\[1\]).

I think that's to be expected, since I've applied to more than 200 positions, and I'm not just making up this number, it's all documented in my [Application Sheet]. Honestly, I didn't have much hope of getting noticed at this point, especially because I was applying to roles in which I had no experience (plus most of them are international). Guess I was wrong. From 200+ applications I got 70 responses, which means more or less a 30% ratio. From those answers, 8 were positive, meaning that they want to proceed to the next step (about 4%).  70% of the companies didn't give me any kind of feedback after 2-4 weeks.

Generally, the next step is a phone interview with the recruiter, but on three occasions I got some kind of online
assessment. Here is where I felt the need for creating yet another application sheet, but this time it's called
[Hiring Process] sheet. This one is specifically for the applications that passed over the resume analysis wall. There I can keep track of all the different steps and deadlines for each position.

Now, this is way better than scrolling through 200+ rows or using `ctrl + f` to find a specific application. I can easily keep track of where I am at for each position. I've also made sure to use a very vibrant orange color for deadlines so I can prioritize and not miss any of them (I've almost forgotten Carta's manager interview). I make sure to check it every day, adjust my plans accordingly, and keep every important date in my calendar.

Alright, I think these two documents together are a really good solution to help someone keep track of their entire application process, from submitting their CV to getting an offer. I mean, if this person is using the same strategy of handing out hundreds of CVs, i.e. they are playing the numbers game\[2\]. Please feel free to make a copy for yourself, I am happy to share.

Fun fact: Today is [International Workers' Day][worker day link], this wasn't intentional.

\[2\]: This is also an interesting topic to explore.
